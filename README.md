ARM is a place for users, to upload,download and manage important documents like Notes, Scholarships and Internships Details for a Particular Discipline. Not only this, By keeping Security and Privacy in Mind, We also created an ADMIN named ARM to look after the documents, That were Uploaded By Various Students!
